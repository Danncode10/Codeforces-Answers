# Codeforces Solutions

Competitive programming has always been a field that requires a sharp mind, quick thinking, and a strong grasp of algorithms and data structures. To enhance my skills and prepare for coding contests, I have created this repository to document my journey through Codeforces problem-solving. This serves as a personal log of progress, a way to analyze my approaches, and a reference point for future challenges.

## My Journey

Solving problems on Codeforces is not just about getting the right answerâ€”itâ€™s about improving logic, optimizing solutions, and learning from mistakes. By maintaining this repository, I can keep track of the problems I have solved, analyze my thought processes, and refine my problem-solving techniques over time. Each solution represents a step forward in my competitive programming journey.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains my solutions to various Codeforces problems, categorized based on difficulty. The goal is to systematically progress from easier problems to more challenging ones, ensuring a solid understanding of different problem-solving techniques. Each solution includes the code implementation and, in some cases, a brief explanation of the approach used.

## Future Goals

Competitive programming is a continuous learning experience. My short-term goal is to solve a set number of problems by a specific date, ensuring consistent practice. Additionally, I aim to participate in upcoming contests to test my skills in a real-time competitive environment. With each contest, I hope to improve my problem-solving speed and accuracy.

## Get in Touch

I welcome discussions on problem-solving approaches and optimizations. If you have any suggestions or insights, feel free to reach out. Collaboration and learning from others are key aspects of becoming a better competitive programmer.

Happy Coding! ðŸŽ¯
